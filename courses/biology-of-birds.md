title: "Biology of Birds (INB 440L)"
---

The Biology of Birds is offered in spring semesters. The content is a synthesis of evolutionary biology, ecology, and behavior. Topics include the role of birds in ecosystems, their anatomy and physiology, the physics of flight, breeding systems and sexual selection, migration, population dynamics, avian communities, and bird conservation. The 1-hour lectures have traditionally been scheduled on Monday and Wednesday at 11am.

The course is field-oriented and counts towards a laboratory and a field class (double check with your advisor as to whether you can claim both credits). Laboratory sessions are scheduled for 3-hours, typically either on a Monday or Tuesday afternoon. For the first and last 1/3 of the course, we organize weekly 1/2-day field trips (attendance strongly encouraged). During these trips we learn to identify bird species in the field. We also organize two weekend-long (Fri-Sun) field trips: one to the Lower Rio Grande Valley in February and another to High Island/Anahuac NWR in April. Recently, some students are approaching 300 species recorded during the semester. In the lab, we study preserved bird specimens, examine anatomy, especially feathers, and learn a bit of data science using bird data.
